        <h1>h1 – The Hive</h1>
        <p>We’re buzzing in our pews, the electricity of raw gossip flitting around us like so many wings. We feed on it, spread it around like a honey that sticks. Our madam archdeacon is at the center of it all, and if the rumors are true, no vestment can hide her guilt from the likes of us.</p>
        <p>The service is about to start. The organ hums to life, signalling the start of the processional: the venerable queen is about to emerge. Suspicion thickens the air like pollen. Our faces turn towards the narthex, primed to sting. Conditions are favorable for swarming.</p>
        
        <h2>h2 – All Things Bright and Beautiful</h2>
        <p>Under northern skies in a hotel bed he is shifting in tidal sleep, from foyer bar oblivion. Blankly, perched at the bedside table, he has woken to January’s ashen afternoon. He scrawls then at fragments with a pen. The dream. A derelict warehouse, fingers phrasing over a hundred pianos. He knew too much, then ran from uniforms down escalators across glass buildings.</p>
        <p>Under his window, all are in black and older. Friends raining. Waiting for taxis to the crematorium and later “All Things Bright and Beautiful,” sung for a mother too distant; muted where birds still swoop over the stones.</p>
        
        <h3>h3 – You Couldn’t Wait to Leave This Town</h3>
        <p>Concrete steps rise from pebbly cracked sidewalks, but go, absurdly, nowhere. Into the boards of a fence, or the sunless dirt beneath a low tree limb. An empty lot. A telephone pole. Eighty years ago, a raging summer fire leveled everything for miles, and when the town returned, it shifted—just a little—and left these oddities. Growing up, I barely noticed. They were part of the salty, wind-bent landscape, pointless. Who cared?</p>
        <p>But time passes. Smoke clears. Now I see: they’re reminders, ways back. Someone lived here. And here. And here. The steps don’t go nowhere. They go home.</p>
        
        <h4>h4 – Sweetie Pie</h4>
        <p>I started calling both my dog and husband Sweetie Pie the same year my husband found my lover’s cashmere sock. I’d stuffed it in my coat pocket after tugging at it nestled like a snake down my pants’ leg. But it escaped flaccidly onto our stone entryway. After my dogwalk up and around the hill, the city nestled below us, its rivers aquiver, I unhooked the leash. I said, “Oh, Sweetie Pie. I’ll always love you.” Then, as the dog skittered to his kibble, I saw my husband’s hand and the fine knit. I said, “Oh, Sweetie Pie.”</p>
        
        <h5>h5 – Great Composers of the American Popular Song</h5>
        <p>A window opens on a forest: trees, moonlight, a path. You’ve been here before: the knot in a pine becomes a long-lost face, the veil of leaves a scarf of blue silk. You startle a flock of birds into flight and their cries echo a song playing in a tiny room wreathed in cigarette smoke. Through the window, the man at the piano sees a large house in a small town, his grandmother’s tulips, the fall of his sister’s hair. At the word song his eyes meet yours and his fingers pause on the keys: birds over a starlit canyon.</p>
        
        <h6>h6 – My Daughter’s Hands</h6>
        <p>They once drew from four strings Elgar’s Cello Concerto in E minor. Her arms danced about mahogany stained pine as partners, pulling to and fro. Haunting echoes of Jacqueline du Pre and her troubled brilliance. Now they search for the hint of a vein. Stretches of pale flesh once lined by purple blue channels, rivers and streams erased from a map. Rivulets atop her hands dry. She pokes and prods between fingers with the fine point of a syringe, looking for an opening to inject blessed numbness. Her cello gathers ghost notes of dust. My daughter’s hands, instruments of betrayal.</p>
